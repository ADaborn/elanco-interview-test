This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started - API

First, install the dependencies for the backend API

```bash
cd backend/
npm install
```

Next run the Node application with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

The Node GraphQL API should now be running on http://localhost:4000/

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the GraphQL sandbox. You can query the API through it.

## Getting Started - Front-end

In a separate command-prompt, navigate to the project's root folder, and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once installed, compile the code and run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The NextJS front-end should now be visible on http://localhost:3000

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.
